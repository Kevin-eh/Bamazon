Welcome to the TrollSkull Shoppe. Here you will find a plethora (ten) of items a weary traveler or brave adventure will need.

Upon activating bamazonCuster.js, you will be greeted by the shopkeepr and shown the shops stock

First, you will be asked to enter the ID of the item you'd like to buy

Then, you will be asked how many of the item you would like

If there is enough of that item in stock, the shopkeeper will take the total price in gold coins from you, and the amount you purchased will be removed from the stores inventory.

IF there is NOT enough of that item, the shopkeepr will get all kinds of mad and kick you out. Actually, even if you buy a good amount he'll still clsoe up shoppe. But when you come back, you'll see the inventory will reflect your purchases.
